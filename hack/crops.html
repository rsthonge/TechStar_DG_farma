    <h2>Rice</h2>
    <p>Rice is known as a Kharif crop. The massive cultivation of rice covers about one-third of the country's total cultivated area. Rice cultivation provides food to more than half of the natives of India, forming the staple food of the population. The crop is cultivated in almost all central states in India. The top three rice-producing states in India are West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab. Other than these states, there are several other states in India also known for producing a considerable amount of rice. The states include Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra. The crop is also grown in parts of Kerala, Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and the valleys of Kashmir.

        Rice harvesting is a time of celebration in India. Farmers in West Bengal call it the ‘Nuakhai’ (also called ‘Nabanna’) festival and celebrate it in the month of August- the time of rice harvest. The festival is a thanksgiving festival, being grateful to the Hindu Gods for blessing them with abundant food. The word ‘Nua’ stands for ‘new,’ and the word ‘khai’ means ‘to eat’ in Bengali. Similarly, other known harvest festivals of India include Baisakhi or Vaisakhi, Pongal, Lohri, Makar Sankranti and more.

     <h2>Wheat</h2>
     <p>
        Wheat is the second most commonly cultivated crop in India after Rice. Wheat is predominantly known as a Rabi Crop. Wheat products form the staple food in most parts of the country, especially the north-western region of India. Even though the crop is a winter crop and requires low temperatures to grow well, due to the high productivity of the soil in the country, the crop grows all year round in most parts of the country. The preferred temperature for wheat cultivation ranges between 10-15°C during the time of sowing and 21-26°C during the time of harvesting. Wheat grows well in the optimum range of 75 cm of rainfall to 100 cm rainfall. 
       The best soil for wheat cultivation would be well-drained fertile loamy soil which is clayey in texture. For optimal growth of the crop, plain regions are highly preferred by farmers. Due to advancements in farming methods, wheat crop harvest has become highly mechanized and may need less human labour. The major states producing high-quality abundant wheat are Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab.
